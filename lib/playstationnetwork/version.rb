        Profile:    ::U::User.profile('pacMakaveli90')                 -> ::User.new('pacMakaveli90').profile
        Games:      ::U::Games.all('pacMakaveli90')                    -> ::User.new('pacMakaveli90').games
        Trophies:   ::U::Trophies.all('pacMakaveli90', 'NPWR00132_00') -> ::User.new('pacMakaveli90').trophies('NPWR00132_00')
        
        # Games
        #
        Game:       ::G::Game.find('NPWR00132_00')                     -> ::Game.new('NPWR00132_00').details
        Trophies:   ::G::Trophies.all('NPWR00132_00')                  -> ::Game.new('NPWR00132_00').trophies
        All:        ::G::Games.all('all')                              -> ::Game.new().all(platform: 'ps4') # default 'all'
        Popular:    ::G::Games.popular()                               -> ::Game.new().all(popular: true)

      v2.0.1
        - When requesting Games for a specific user, return only the games instead of a full response which returns the same data that ::User.new('pacMakaveli90').profile already returns

      v2.1.0
        - Added 'verify: false' to HTTParty default options to skip any SSL certification errors. Temporary measure until we can figure how to fix this.

      v2.1.1
        - Tidy up the code and add a new option which should make internal calls cleaner

      v2.1.2
        - Added 'verify: false' option introduced in v2.1.0 as a configurable option in the initializer

      v2.2
        - Added experimental PlayStation Store endpoint

      v3.0
        - (major) The API now returns OpenStruct objects instead of plain JSON
        - (major) 
        - Removed HTTParty dependency and used Ruby's Net::HTTP
        - Removed a lot of logic and simplified the code and classes
        - Integrated experimental PlayStation Stores endpoints into the gem
        - Added Cache
